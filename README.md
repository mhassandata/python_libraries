# **Python Libraries**
# python_libraries
In this repo we will convered the nessaries libraris in Data Science, Machine Learning and Deep Learning so here are the Libraries:

  - *Numpy*
  - *Pandas*
  - *Matplotlib*
  - *Seaborn*
  - *Sciket Learn*
  - *Keras*
  - *TensorFlow*
  
This repo is all about the libraries of python which are mentioned above.

**Numpy**  

Numpy Numerical Python (NumPy) is an open source Python library for scientific computing. NumPy provides a host of features that allow a Python programmer to work with high-performance arrays and matrices. NumPy arrays are stored more efficiently than Python lists and allow mathematical operations to be vectorized, which results in significantly higher performance than with looping constructs in Python.
Pandas Pandas is a software library written for the Python programming language for data manipulation and analysis. It provides data structures and operations for manipulating numerical tables and time series data. It is widely used in data science and machine learning for data preparation and manipulation. Some of the key features of pandas include dataframe and series objects, reading and writing data to various file formats, handling missing data, and advanced data manipulation techniques such as merging and reshaping datasets
Data analysis library
Series Single Dimension
Dataframe Multidimensional
